<h3>What is this application?</h3>
This application was primarily to enable Google users to search books by hitting the Google API and saving their selected books to their personal Google accounts, wherever, whenever.

## Motive
As a Full Stack Developer, the primary motive was to build a full-stack application by utilizing an ORM methodology and establishing a MVC framework. Exerting these types of practices provides an organized/clean environment and allows other developers to maneuver around the code with ease.
